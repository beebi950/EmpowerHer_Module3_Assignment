a) Component Lifecycle in React Functional Components

In functional components, React manages the component lifecycle using the useEffect hook.

1️ Mount Phase

The mount phase occurs when a component is rendered for the first time.

This is represented by:

useEffect(() => {
  // runs once after initial render
}, []);


Common uses: API calls, event listeners, timers.

2️ Update Phase

The update phase occurs whenever specified dependencies change.

This is represented by:

useEffect(() => {
  // runs when dependency value changes
}, [dependency]);


Common uses: reacting to state/prop changes, recalculations.

3️ Unmount Phase

The unmount phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM.

This is handled using a cleanup function returned from useEffect.

useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // cleanup code
  };
}, []);

b) What is a Cleanup Function? Why Is It Needed?
🔹 What is a Cleanup Function?

A cleanup function is a function returned inside useEffect.

It executes before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again.

🔹 Why is it Needed?

Cleanup functions are needed to:

Remove event listeners

Clear timers or intervals

Cancel API subscriptions

Prevent memory leaks

Avoid unwanted background processes

🔹 Example
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Running...");
  }, 1000);

  return () => {
    clearInterval(timer); // cleanup
  };
}, []);
